3. In navigation mode the page is analyzed as it loads while in snapshot it analyzes the page in its current state
4. The results are an error on all 4 categories - Performance, Accessibility, SEO and Best Practices. Using more efficient coding practices minimizing runtimes and maximizing accessibility, less third party use.
